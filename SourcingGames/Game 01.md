## Solution
### Task 1

![[Pasted image 20250502012732.png]]

This is a site to which I was transferred when the game started. Generally speaking nothing to interact about. So first thing I did was checking HTML of the site.

With use of developer tools I manged to find a flag hidden in dev comment.

### Task 2

This time goal is to find name of a person showed on the picture.

Quick reverse image search and i find out that the name of this person is **Todd Boyce**.

### Task 3
![[Pasted image 20250502013829.png]]

To find the date of creation of this URL I decided to find look for some online tool which can provide some extra info about bit.ly links.

Luckily bitly provides this type of service by its own and with use of it it was easy to find required information.

### Task 4
![[Pasted image 20250502014558.png]]

To find this specific email I looked for some email finder tools

![[Pasted image 20250502015835.png]]

I used tool hunter.io and searched for emails by name and company domain but email which I have received was incorrect so i decided to try other tools of this kind

Luckily with this tool (https://anymailfinder.com) I did get correct answer to this task.

### Task 5
![[Pasted image 20250502022010.png]]

This time i had to find a first name of this StackOverflow user.

![[Pasted image 20250502022231.png]]

Finding the name was easier than I thought. Only thing which I had to do was checking his github profile.

### Task 6
![[Pasted image 20250502022731.png]]

To find information of this sort I decided to do some basic Google Dorking.

![[Pasted image 20250502022827.png]]

With the use of **intitle** attribute and given domain it was fairly easy to find a password
